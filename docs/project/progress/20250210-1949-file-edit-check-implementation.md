# File Edit Check MCP Server Implementation Session

## Context
Implemented a new MCP server to prevent blind file modifications and ensure detailed commit documentation.

## Session Goals
1. Implement pre-read verification for file modifications
2. Add commit message guidance to tool responses
3. Document implementation details and rationale

## Implementation Details

### Core Safety Feature
The server prevents blind writes by requiring explicit file reads before modifications:

```typescript
// Track which files have been read
const readFiles = new Set<string>();

// Pre-modification verification
if (exists && !readFiles.has(path)) {
  throw new McpError(
    ErrorCode.InvalidRequest,
    `Blind write prevented: File "${path}" exists. Please use checked_read_file to verify the file before modifying it.`
  );
}
```

### Commit Message Guidance
Each write/diff operation returns guidance for creating detailed commit messages:

```typescript
const COMMIT_MESSAGE_GUIDANCE = `Create a detailed, specific, measured, descriptive commit message that leaves meticulous forensic evidence for future users and agents to know and understand every action and intention...`;
```

## Tools Implemented
1. checked_read_file - Reads and marks files as safe for modification
2. checked_write_to_file - Verifies pre-read before writing
3. checked_apply_diff - Ensures diffs only apply to read files

## Testing Results
- Successfully prevented blind writes to existing files
- Enforced read-before-write pattern
- Added commit message guidance to responses

## Next Steps
1. Monitor usage patterns and gather feedback
2. Consider adding file content verification
3. Explore integration with other MCP servers

## Session Notes
- Implementation focused on preventing accidental overwrites
- Added comprehensive error messages to guide proper usage
- Documented all changes with detailed commit messages

## Decisions Made
1. Use in-memory Set for tracking read files
2. Clear file state after successful modifications
3. Include commit message guidance in tool responses
